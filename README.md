# A Century of Negro Migration

This project is designed to create a new edition of Carter Woodson's <em>A Century of Negro Migration.</em> The existing digital version at [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10968), which is the basis for most versions floating around the internet and on Amazon, is missing the figures and maps and has no formatting for the tables and footnotes.
